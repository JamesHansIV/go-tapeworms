### Adding Feature Selection Modals
**Figma**
Separate each panel into three sections: feature name (heading), description (optional), and the image group. The Image Group can be a collection of images, text, and vectors, but must all be under the same group within Figma. The Image Group must be exported to .PNG for use in the application.
